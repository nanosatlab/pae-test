This git push contains a basic hpp for the Data class we've been discussing. It still needs
modifiations and also to create it's dervate classes, but for the moment it serves a guide
for the format of the data we need to handle, tomorrow we can finish it's design.

I also uploaded the class I'm currently writting for anyone who needs to check it's structure
or members.

to modify this repo you will need to do:
git clone git@github.com:nanosatlab/pae-test.git

once you've modified do:
git add *
git commit
git push origin master
